		<h2 id="QW">Why Perspectives are Important</h2>
		<p class="center">Why are <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/perspective"> perspectives </a> important? Seeing from another person&rsquo;s perspective would help you to understand what sort of situation or problem they are going through. The person who is causing the events to happen is because they have a reason for doing so&#59; everyone grows up differently and has different views of the world, so there isn&rsquo;t a right or wrong answer when it comes to who is at fault. Let&rsquo;s say that you and your friend were having an argument, what causes an argument? When two sides disagree with each other. There are reasons for both opposing sides, you and your friend might not agree on the same thing because you faced the situation differently and rather than forcing the other side to agree, try to understand why the argument is there in the first place. </p>
		<h2 id="UV">Understanding a point of view</h2>
		<!-- This is a paragraph tag, it is used to show written information about the topics-->
		<p class="center">Why is understanding a point of view important? One reason is to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings. Why do misunderstandings occur? It is because we tend to assume that everyone else will think the same way we do, while that is not true, that is what people think about everyone else most of the time. So, rather than leading the problem further it is best to think about it and try to understand why someone is taking that action.

		<ul>
			<li>More communication and understanding</li>
			<li>Building empathy</li>
			<li>Learning and growing based on others</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="center">Not only are there less problems to deal with, but there is more communication which leads to an eventual solution. Another reason it is important to understand someone&rsquo;s perspective is because everyone thinks differently and there is a chance that two people will not assess the situation the same way. Everyone has gone through different experiences and different events in their life, some might be more inexperienced because they have not met the issue before, but some might be more experienced because they have met that issue multiple times.
		It is also important to recognize someone&rsquo;s mood and physique because that can affect the way that person thinks. Sometimes the importance of an object has gained someone&rsquo;s attention which causes them to care more about that object than anything else, for example if someone is hungry while in an argument, they will care less about the conflict and care more about the food that is in the room.
		Sometimes you may learn something new from others. When you look at someone else&rsquo;s perspective there is a chance that you can learn something new. When you look through your own view, it is different from when you look at someone else&rsquo;s. There is a saying that we can learn from each other&rsquo;s differences, so we can learn from our perspectives or what we see in the world from each other.

		<h2 id="DW">How Perspectives Establish better relationships </h2>
		<p class="center">Understanding perspectives helps us communicate better and have better relationships. If there are misunderstandings all the time, then there will be arguments as the results. Remember that whatever healthy relationship you are in, whether it is with friends, family, partners, or co-workers, it is important to establish good relationships with each other because you all are on a team together and are needed to face obstacles that come in the way. So, why are perspectives important to establish stronger and better relationships? Agreements are based on whether all or most of the participants agree, and there can be people who disagree, if you are one of those people, try and think about why the ideas in the agreement might be a good proposition instead of why it might not. Now, people love getting to be correct for anything, so even though some ideas might not be the best or can be unique, try to understand why they might think like that and what are the issues these ideas can solve rather than pointing out who is right or wrong and good or bad.
		</p>
		<h2 id="C">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="center">The way and environment we grow up in has an impact on how we think and our perspectives on certain things. We are all unique in diverse ways, so we all think differently than the people around us whether it is because of how we grow up, the experiences we have accumulated, the mood we are in or the physiques that our bodies are in.
