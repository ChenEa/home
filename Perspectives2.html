		<h2 id="AE">Adventures through another Pair of Eyes</h2>
		<p class="center">Through the vast world of adventure, the setting could be in a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prehistoric"> prehistoric </a>one, ancient, futuristic, magical, wilderness, and even more&#33; What excites me about these stories is how we get to see these worlds through a different pair of eyes. Each world is interesting and unique because we all live in a society where it&rsquo;s sometimes dull and could sometimes feel repetitive, so stories bring more than just a few words on a page, humans are also creatures who enjoy entertainment and something entirely new. Not only that, but humans are also very empathic creatures, we like to connect with each other and when we are connecting to characters in a story, it makes us interested and invested. So, how are perspectives so important in literature?  </p>
		<h2 id="UC">Understanding and Connections</h2>
		<!-- This is a paragraph tag, it is used to show written information about the topics-->
		<p class="center">Literature is anything that has a written work that has a story that is forming, and you know how in movies, novels, short stories, books, and films always have a protagonist or protagonist? That is because when the author introduces these characters the plot is going to revolve around them. 
 		The &#8220;readers&#8221; or &#8220;viewers&#8221; are going along with these protagonists in the story. Whenever you are feeling extremely upset because a character in a story died, it means that we recognize that character as a person who had a connection with us because so much information about that character was given to us and we decided that this person is a friend. Another point could be because there was so much build up to the specific moment which caused us to be so emotional. While understanding a story and going along with the characters&rsquo; trip, we also have the perspective of being a part of their journey and success. As the story progresses, we (as the reader/viewer/ participant) will understand why the protagonist is going through these adventures. They have goals they want to reach at the end and that is why there is a story behind all these actions and journeys.  
		</p> 
 
		<h2 id="IDW">Recognizing Different Thinking and Ideas</h2>
		<p class="center">In stories, our perspective is limited to see what the main character or characters are doing, because they are the people who drive the plot forward. The characters&rsquo; responses are what defines the events that will happen. The people reading or watching the story will experience everything the main characters are encountering.  
		Why is reading books an important part of understanding perspectives? After all this talk about literature, perspectives, relationships. How are books going to help us understand? Well, since the main characters in a story are different and have different thinking than others, we get to see how different their ideas are and how they are going to use these ideas to solve a problem. In stories, we see how the main characters solve their problems in their own way, then the question is, are our thinking the same as the main characters&rsquo;? Could be or not, their thinking could contrast our own thinking which can be interesting, and we should know that everyone is different so they think differently, it could depend on different variables like culture, tradition, environment, and personality. So, when we are following along with these characters, we can gradually get a sense of why they might choose the course of action rather than another. The characters could sit there and do absolutely nothing, but because they have their goals and their own way of solving problems, they would not do that. Same goes with things that happen in real life, people have their reasons and habits of doing things and you can offer suggestions, but do not forcefully try to argue what type of action is best to take. 
 
		</p>
		<h2 id="C">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="center">Experiencing a perspective through stories can help us understand different ideas and courses of actions, we can learn and enjoy these stories&#59; understanding the differences we have and the perspectives we see problems in. Reading or watching a story in another person&rsquo;s perspective allows us to gain some experience with different ideas and thinking, and in real life, we can all learn from each other, understand where these ideas come from and give advice to a friendâ€™s idea to make it better.
